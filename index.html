            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
            current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
            got every penny’s worth.

            &quot;I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve
            been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had
            an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course
            and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next
            12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
            completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working
            as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.&quot;

            Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themsselves.
            Getting guidance from them ad learning from their experiences was
            easy.

            &quot;The staff seem geniunely concerned about my progress which I
            find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary
            to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
            junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the
            personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart
            and amazing people.&quot;

            &quot;Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of
            code. I needed some structure from progessionals who can help me
            learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
            former student of theirs who can only say wondergful things about
            the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
            They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
            The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
            learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
            have. In fact, I've reffered to it during interviews as an example
            of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
            full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
            recommend!.&quot;
